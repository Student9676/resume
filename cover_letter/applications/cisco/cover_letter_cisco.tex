% Opening salutation
\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

% Introduction
I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineering Internship at Cisco Systems
which I learned about through a friend at my University. I am a junior pursuing 
a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics at Emory University.

% Body paragraph 1: Discuss your background and skills
Currently, I am working as a Technical Research Intern as a part of the National Science Foundation's 
Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. During this experience, I have learned to 
collaborate with students of varying magnitudes of experiences and work hands-on with technologies at 
the forefront of the Computer Science field. I am continuously being exposed to new ideas 
and code that I have to understand, utilize, and adapt to research goals. 

Simultaneously, I am working on a project with the Carlos Museum on campus to train recent 
artificial intelligence models to solve complex problems like detecting language biases and 
replacing them for inclusivity and diversity goals. I have also gained valuable project management 
and user interface design skills through my role as an iOS App Development Intern at U.S.A. Boccia 
where I worked on planning, designing, and developing an app to be used in nationwide Boccia games. 

% Body paragraph 2: Discuss why you're a good fit for the company
A career at Cisco Systems is desirable for me due to its leadership in network solutions 
development. Cisco not only builds technologies to enable connections but
goes the extra mile by simultaneously securing communications and striving for inclusion. 
I believe that Computer Science is inherently multidisciplinary and interconnected with greater themes
of our world and Cisco parallels that by developing technologies with global issues in mind like our 
planet's future and our changing geopolitical environment as echoed by Fran Katsoudas in Cisco's 
2023 Purpose Report.

% Closing paragraph: Thank the reader and express enthusiasm
I am excited to contribute to and learn as much as possible from this experience. I hope to discuss
this opportunity with you in more detail soon. Thank you for your time and consideration. \\\\

% Closing salutation
\closing{Sincerely, \\
