% Opening salutation
\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

% Introduction
I am writing to express my interest in the Mobile Software Engineer Intern at TikTok
which I learned about through a friend at my university. I am a junior pursuing 
a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics at Emory University.

% Body paragraph 1: Discuss your background and skills
Currently, I am working as a Technical Research Intern as a part of the National Science Foundation's 
Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. During this experience, I have learned to 
collaborate with students of varying magnitudes of experiences and work hands-on with technologies at 
the forefront of the Computer Science field. I am continuously being exposed to new ideas 
and code that I have to understand, utilize, and adapt to research goals. 

Simultaneously, I am working on a project with the Carlos Museum on campus to train recent 
artificial intelligence models to solve ethically complex problems like detecting language biases and 
replacing them for inclusivity goals. I have also gained valuable project management 
and user interface design skills through my iOS App Development Internship at U.S.A. Boccia 
where I worked on planning, designing, and developing a finished app to be used in nationwide Boccia games. 

% Body paragraph 2: Discuss why you're a good fit for the company
A career at Roblox is desirable for me due to its unique, innovative product, Roblox, that is a flexible 
platform that can serve multiple purposes: to connect, entertain, support and much more. 
Such a product is not present in the market. Roblox not only innovates its platform but also its workplace
by updating its core values and principles with time, acknowledging that improvements need to be made
over time. I believe that Computer Science is inherently multidisciplinary and Roblox parallels that 
by making strides in the entertainment and connectedness capabilities of its platform by developing new 
technologies with growth in mind.

% Closing paragraph: Thank the reader and express enthusiasm
I am excited to contribute to and learn as much as possible from this internship. I hope to discuss
this opportunity with you in more detail soon. Thank you for your time and consideration.\\

% Closing salutation
\closing{Sincerely, \\
