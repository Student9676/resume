\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

% Introduction
I am writing to express my interest in the Fullstack Software Engineer Intern position at Microsoft
which I learned about through a friend at my university. I am a junior pursuing 
a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics at Emory University.

% Body paragraph 1: Discuss your background and skills
Currently, I am working as a Technical Research Intern as a part of the National Science Foundation's 
Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. During this experience, I have learned to 
collaborate with students of varying magnitudes of experiences and work hands-on with technologies at 
the forefront of the Computer Science field. I am continuously being exposed to new ideas 
and code that I have to understand, utilize, and adapt to research goals. 

Simultaneously, I am working on a project with the Carlos Museum on campus to train recent 
artificial intelligence models to solve ethically complex problems like detecting language biases and 
replacing them for inclusivity goals. I have also gained valuable project management 
and user interface design skills through my iOS App Development Internship at U.S.A. Boccia 
where I worked on planning, designing, and developing a finished app to be used in nationwide Boccia games. 

% Body paragraph 2: Discuss why you're a good fit for the company
A career at Microsoft is desirable for me due to its innovative products that serve a wide range of purposes
from connecting people to driving productivity. Microsoft's products have become a staple in 
the workplace and other areas because of their intuitiveness and capability. I deeply respect Microsoft
because of this, and believe that these principles are core to developing a product and essential for developers to think about.
Computer Science is inherently multidisciplinary since it can be used for a variety of applications
which is why I think that I am a great fit for this role with my interdisciplinary applicative experiences, creative critical thinking capabilities,
and communicative, quick learning abilities. 

% Closing paragraph: Thank the reader and express enthusiasm
I am excited to contribute to and learn as much as possible from this internship. Hopefully, I will
discuss this opportunity with you in more detail soon. Thank you for your time and consideration.

% Closing salutation
\closing{Sincerely, \\
