\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

% Introduction
I am writing to express my interest in the iOS Engineer Apprenticeship at Fetch. I am a junior pursuing 
a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics at Emory University.

% Body paragraph 1: Discuss your background and skills
Last semester, I worked at USA Boccia as an iOS App Development Intern. In this role I was tasked to 
develop a match-keeping app for iPad from scratch given only designs of the desired app. Using this skeleton, 
in a group of two, I employed my active learning skills to learn Swift and Objective-C while, simultaneously,
building the app. Although I already had User Experience Design skills from previous coursework, these skills
were enhanced as I provided suggestions in design meetings to make the app interface more modern
yet intuitive to support new users. After planning and designing we developed a finished app 
to be used in nationwide paralymic Boccia games organized by USA Boccia.

Currently, I am working as a Technical Research Intern as a part of the NSF's 
REU program. During this experience, I have  
collaborated with different students to work hands-on with the latest technologies.
I am continuously being exposed to new ideas 
and code that I have to understand, utilize, and adapt to research goals. Simultaneously, I am working on a project with the Carlos Museum on campus to train recent 
artificial intelligence models to solve ethically complex problems like detecting language biases and 
replacing them for inclusivity goals.

% Body paragraph 2: Discuss why you're a good fit for the company
A career at Fetch is desirable for me due to its unique service that was built to intuitively solve the problem
of package thefts, increasing package security and accountability for apartment communities. Computer Science
is inherently multidisciplinary and so its applications, especially in software development, at their core should 
be solution-oriented to create intuitive solutions; Fetch achieves this with their service and app. Additionally,
these intuitive solutions can only be created through collaboration between people of different backgrounds, 
academic and social, which reflect Fetch's work culture. So I believe that my creative problem-solving skills 
and communicative teamwork capabilities make me a good fit for this role and a career at Fetch.

% Closing paragraph: Thank the reader and express enthusiasm
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you in detail soon.

% Closing salutation
\closing{Sincerely, \\
