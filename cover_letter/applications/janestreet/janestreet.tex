\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

% Introduction
I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer Internship at Jane Street
which I learned about through a friend at my university. I am a junior pursuing 
a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics at Emory University.

% Body paragraph 1: Discuss your background and skills
Currently, I am working as a Technical Research Intern as a part of the National Science Foundation's 
Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. During this experience, I have learned to 
collaborate with students of varying magnitudes of experiences and work hands-on with technologies at 
the forefront of the Computer Science field. I am continuously being exposed to new ideas 
and code that I have to understand, utilize, and adapt to research goals. 

Simultaneously, I am working on a project with the Carlos Museum on campus to train recent 
artificial intelligence models to solve complex problems like detecting language biases and 
replacing them for inclusivity and diversity goals. I have also gained valuable project management 
and user interface design skills through my role as an iOS App Development Intern at U.S.A. Boccia 
where I worked on planning, designing, and developing an app to be used in nationwide Boccia games. 

% Body paragraph 2: Discuss why you're a good fit for the company
A career at Jane Street is desirable for me due to its leadership in quantitative trading. 
Jane Street not only builds mathematical technologies to optimize trading in financial markets
but also goes the extra mile by responsibly managing risks and making sure that its employees can 
collaborate freely and state their own opinions. 
I believe that Computer Science is inherently multidisciplinary and Jane Street parallels that 
by developing technologies for success in rapidly changing financial markets by promoting collaboration
of different ideas and ideologies.

% Closing paragraph: Thank the reader and express enthusiasm
I am excited to contribute to and learn as much as possible from this internship. I hope to discuss
this opportunity with you in more detail soon. Thank you for your time and consideration. \\\\

% Closing salutation
\closing{Sincerely, \\
