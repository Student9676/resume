\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

% Introduction
I am writing to express my interest in the Digital and Technology Internship position at General Mills 
as advertised on Handshake and the "You Are Here" event. I am a junior pursuing a bachelor's degree in 
Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics at Emory University.

% Body paragraph 1: Discuss your background and skills
Currently, I am working as a Technical Research Intern under the National Science Foundation's 
Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. During this experience, I have learned to 
collaborate with students of varying magnitudes of experiences and work hands-on with technologies at 
the forefront of the Computer Science field. I am continuously being exposed to new ideas 
and code that I have to understand, utilize, and adapt to research goals. 

Simultaneously, I am working on a project with the Carlos Museum on campus to train recent 
artificial intelligence models to solve complex problems like detecting language biases and 
replacing them for inclusivity and diversity goals. I have also gained valuable project management 
and user interface design skills through my role as an iOS App Development Intern at U.S.A. Boccia 
where I worked on planning, designing, and developing an app to be used in nationwide Boccia games. 

% Body paragraph 2: Discuss why you're a good fit for the company
I am particularly drawn to General Mills due to its prominent position in the food industry. Not only
does General Mills produce high-quality food, but it also commits to transparency about its 
ingredients and offers healthy alternatives with customers' needs in mind. I believe that my 
attention to detail, ability to take smart risks, and friendly attitude align closely with 
the company's culture and product goals.

% Closing paragraph: Thank the reader and express enthusiasm
I am excited to contribute to and learn as much as possible from this experience. I hope to discuss
this opportunity with you in more detail soon. Thank you for your time and consideration. \\\\

% Closing salutation
\closing{Sincerely, \\
