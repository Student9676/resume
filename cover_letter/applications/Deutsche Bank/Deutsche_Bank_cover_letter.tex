% Introduction
I am writing to express interest in the Technology, Data and Innovation Internship at the Deutsche Bank. I am a junior pursuing 
a BSc in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics at Emory University, looking for an internship where I can 
contribute to important projects and improve my skills.

Currently, I am working as a Technical Research Intern as a part of the National Science Foundation's 
REU program at Emory. During this experience, I have  
collaborated and communicated with academically and socially diverse students to work with the latest technologies in the field.
Continuous exposure to new ideas and technologies—that I have to understand, 
utilize, and adapt to research goals—has made me adaptable and a fast-learner. 
In addition, my experience developing an AI-based language bias pruner for the
Michael C. Carlos Museum from scratch over the summer gave me experience with 
applications of technology and all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


% Body paragraph 1: Discuss your background and skills
Additionally, last semester, I worked at USA Boccia as an iOS App Development Intern 
where I employed my time management and active learning 
skills to learn Swift while developing a match-keeping app for a para sport 
called Boccia. I helped 
develop a modern interface to speed up volunteer onboarding and increase
accessibility for participants at nationwide Boccia games and tournaments.

Through these applied experiences I have had one key takeaway: critical thinking 
capabilities are more important than skills, especially in technical
settings where innovation roots from novel approaches. This ideology allowed me to 
innovate, solve, and create. The same idea has been echoed through the job 
description and the Deutsche Bank's career website. In addition, the intersection 
of finance and technology at the Bank parallels my interdisciplinary experiences.
I look forward to learning more about the finance world while contributing my coding
skills to creatively engineer software and develop Machine Learning based solutions
to business-critical projects. Solutions developed by the Deutsche Bank 
like RatingBot and PayTrack excite me, promising a culture of innovation; these
projects' continued improvement and growth also shows a culture of continued 
improvement and growth which are likable qualities for me. 

% Closing paragraph: Thank the reader and express enthusiasm
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you in detail soon.
