% Introduction
I am writing to express interest in the Summer 2025 FOX Technology Internship Program. I am a junior pursuing 
a BSc in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics at Emory University, looking for an internship where I can 
contribute to important projects and improve my skills.

Currently, I am a Technical Research Intern as a part of the National Science Foundation's 
REU program at Emory. During this experience, I have  
collaborated with diverse students to work with the latest 
technologies.
Continuous exposure to new ideas and technologies—that I have to understand, 
utilize, and adapt to research goals—has made me adaptable and a fast-learner. 
In addition, my experience developing an AI-based language bias pruner for the
Michael C. Carlos Museum over the summer gave me experience with 
applications of technology and all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


% Body paragraph 1: Discuss your background and skills
Additionally, last semester, I worked at USA Boccia as an iOS App Development Intern 
where I employed my time management and active learning 
skills to learn Swift while developing a match-keeping app for a para sport 
called Boccia. By learning the specifications of the app I also got experience with
the sports industry, relevant to FOX's industry.
I delivered a modern interface to speed up volunteer onboarding and increase
accessibility for participants at nationwide Boccia games and tournaments.

Through these applied experiences I have had one key takeaway: creativity and proactivity 
are more important than raw skills, especially in, seemingly rigid, technical
settings where innovation roots from novel approaches. I appreciate that this idea has 
been echoed through the job 
description and FOX's career website. In addition, the intersection 
of entertainment and technology at FOX parallels my interdisciplinary experiences.
I look forward to learning more about the entertainment world while creatively engineering
software and developing AI based solutions
for audience-focused, business-critical projects. Additionally, solutions developed by the FOX Tech Team
like automated behavior tagging (similar to my artifact bias tagging project at the museum) 
and performance improvement for FOX's iOS app excite me, 
promising a culture of innovation; focus on continued improvement and growth also 
shows a culture of continued improvement and growth which are likable qualities for me. 

% Closing paragraph: Thank the reader and express enthusiasm
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you in detail soon.
