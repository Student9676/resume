% Introduction
I am writing to express interest in the Software Developer Internship U.S. News \& World Report. I am a junior, pursuing 
a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics at Emory University and looking for an internship where I can 
contribute to important projects and improve my skills.

Currently, I am working on a full-stack project with a group of Emory students, 
developing an AI (not ML) schedule builder for undergraduates. I am gaining
experience with industry-standard development frameworks and programs like FastAPI, 
React, and PostgreSQL. This project has also helped me gain experience with the 
Scrum Agile methodology and collaboration on software engineering projects.

Last semester, I finished working as a Technical Research Intern as a part of the 
National Science Foundation's 
REU program at Emory. During this experience, I gained continuous exposure 
to new ideas and technologies that I implemented for research projects
which made me a fast-learner. Additionally, I worked at U.S.A. Boccia as an iOS Developer Intern 
where I employed my time management and active learning 
skills to learn Swift while developing a match-keeping app for a para sport 
called Boccia.

The U.S. News \& World Report's career website and this position's description 
places emphasis on innovation and collaboration. These qualities are reflected in 
my experiences. Additionally, the intersection 
of journalism and technology at U.S. News matches my interdisciplinary experiences.
I look forward to learning about the media industry through code contributions
and engineering data-driven solutions for business-critical projects. 
The Best Colleges rankings and Healthiest Communities are some exciting
projects by U.S. News. These promise a culture of innovation and continued growth 
which are likable qualities for me. 

% Closing paragraph: Thank the reader and express enthusiasm
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you in detail soon.
