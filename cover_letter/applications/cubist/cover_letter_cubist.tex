% Opening salutation
\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

% Introduction
I am writing to express my interest in the Quantitative Developer Internship at Point72
which I learned about through a student organization at my University. I am a junior pursuing 
a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics at Emory University.

% Body paragraph 1: Discuss your background and skills
Currently, I am working as a Technical Research Intern as a part of the National Science Foundation's 
Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. During this experience, I have learned to 
collaborate with students of varying magnitudes of experiences and work hands-on with technologies at 
the forefront of the Computer Science field. I am continuously being exposed to new ideas 
and code that I have to understand, utilize, and adapt to research goals. 

Simultaneously, I am working on a project with the Carlos Museum on campus to train recent 
artificial intelligence models to solve complex problems like detecting language biases and 
replacing them for inclusivity and diversity goals. I have also gained valuable project management 
and user interface design skills through my role as an iOS App Development Intern at U.S.A. Boccia 
where I worked on planning, designing, and developing an app to be used in nationwide Boccia games. 

% Body paragraph 2: Discuss why you're a good fit for the company
I am particularly drawn to a career at Point72 due to its prominent work in asset management. 
Point72 not only builds computer-driven trading strategies, but also partakes in rigorous research to 
ensure optimal investing in varied assets. I deeply admire Point72's continued connection with academic
communities which places it at the frontier of the latest financial technology. I believe that 
my attention to detail, analytical skills, and communicative attitude align closely with the 
companyâ€™s culture and its goal of developing new innovative insights into the latest market data.

% Closing paragraph: Thank the reader and express enthusiasm
I am excited to contribute to and learn as much as possible from this experience. I hope to discuss
this opportunity with you in more detail soon. Thank you for your time and consideration. \\\\

\closing{Sincerely, \\
